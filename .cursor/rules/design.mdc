1. Focus on Presentation, Not Structure
Action: Only make changes to className attributes (primarily for Tailwind CSS) and inline style props.
Restriction: Do not change the component's JSX structure. Do not add, remove, or re-nest any components or HTML elements. The existing hierarchy must be preserved.
2. No Logic or State Changes
Action: Operate on the component as if it were static. All changes must be purely visual.
Restriction: Do not introduce any new React hooks, such as useState, useEffect, or useContext. Do not modify any existing application logic or state management.
3. Prefer Utility-First & Component-Scoped Styling
Action: Apply all styling changes directly within the component file using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
Restriction: Avoid creating or modifying global CSS files (e.g., globals.css, index.css). All styling should be self-contained.
4. Proactive Typographic Improvement
Action: Actively suggest and apply changes to font families, sizes (text-lg, text-xl), weights (font-bold, font-semibold), and spacing (letter-spacing) to enhance readability and aesthetics.
5. Encourage Design Exploration via Branching
Action: Frame design suggestions as distinct options. After applying one design, recommend the user to commit it to a new branch (e.g., dev/design-v1, dev/modern-look).
Behavior: Proactively ask if the user would like to explore an alternative design, promoting the creation of multiple visual variations.
